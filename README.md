# Brain_wave_communication

Inspiration:
Why? 
Thousand ideas creates every second and goes waste as it does not get documented at the instant.
Wish I have been able to communicate to Alexa or smart home device through Brain wave EEG kit instead of blabeering without any patent/paper infront of public.

How?

Use a **detachable EEG kit** to train the brainwave and pass the interpreted infromation to a machine for translation and recording.

Reference:

Google animal translator.
Brain wave controlled robotics from pantech solution. 
Detachable EEG Kits are better than neural link chip from Space x which can offcourse convert humans to Cyborgs( connected to internet all the time)

If you can train brainwaves of an animal and humans along the action while they are acting.
you can translate any animal language coming from another planet too based on the pattern collected from all species from earth.


Stat:
There are already so many app which interpretes information from facial landmarks and the sounds they make .
But tech is not improved enought to interprete brain waves.

Resourced needed:
- Sample supervised training - to detect needs to animals
- eat, travel,sad, happy etc.
- EEG kits from Pantech solution
